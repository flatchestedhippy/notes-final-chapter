Hi Russell & Brandon,

After a lot of thought, I’ve decided to step away from my role with the company. Please consider this my two weeks’ notice, with my last day being January 30th, 2026.

I want to thank you for the opportunity to work here over the past six plus years. I’ve appreciated the chance to lead teams, support different clients, and contribute to a wide range of projects. I’m grateful for the trust and opportunities I’ve been given during that time.

I’m committed to making the transition as smooth as possible and will do everything I can to help hand off responsibilities over the next two weeks. If it would be helpful, I’m open to discussing a short extension focused specifically on transition work or key priorities.

Thank you again.

Best,  
Keith
