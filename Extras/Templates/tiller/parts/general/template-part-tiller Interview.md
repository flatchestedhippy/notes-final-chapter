### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas


I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with ___ in real life.

### Core Interview Questions

1. Context  
    “Can you walk me through the last time this happened?”
2. Frequency  
    “How often does this come up for you?”
3. Consequences  
    “What happens if this doesn’t get handled well?”
4. Emotional Heat  
    “What’s the most frustrating part about it?”
5. Existing Solutions  
    “What have you tried so far to deal with this?”  
    Follow-ups:
	- “Why didn’t that fully solve it?”
	- “What do you still dislike about it?”
6. Priority Check  
    “Compared to everything else you’re dealing with, where does this rank?”
7. Ideal Outcome (no pitching)  
    “If this were magically solved, what would be different for you?”
