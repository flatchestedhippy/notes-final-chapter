## Tiller Focus – Hiring Interview Pain

I am tilling for:
Interviewing is time-consuming, exhausting, and mentally draining for hiring managers.

### Why this pain is being explored
- High emotional and time cost
- Repeated responsibility for managers
- Clear impact on productivity and focus
- Access to interviewees is high

### What this pain is NOT
- Recruiting or candidate sourcing
- Recruiting agencies
- ATS feature requests
- Employer branding problems

### Who I am interviewing
- Hiring managers
- Engineering managers
- Directors / CTOs
Criteria:
- Interviewed at least 3 candidates in the last 6 months
- Actively participates in interviews

### What counts as strong signal
- Repeated mention of time drain or fatigue
- Emotional frustration or dread
- Clear opportunity cost (other work pushed aside)
- Existing workarounds or attempts to reduce burden

### What counts as weak signal
- Indifference or resignation (“just part of the job”)
- Interviewing fully delegated away
- No emotional or time impact

### Exit criteria (this experiment ends when)
- 5–7 interviews completed
- Clear pattern OR clear lack of pain

---
### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas


I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with interviewing candidates in real life.

### Core Interview Questions

> Reminder: Record only for transcribe to generate summary

Intro: 
"Thanks again for doing this. Just to restate, I’m not selling anything — I’m trying to understand how interviewing actually shows up in people’s work lives so I can learn from real experience  — not in theory, but in practice."

1. "Can you tell me a bit about your role and whether interviewing candidates is part of it?"
	1. Currently now
	2. LIne level consultant for West Monroe - Senior Architect
	3. If Director level
	4. Did CTO/Director - mgr. since 2000
2. “What does your involvement usually look like — are you doing full interview loops, occasional panels, or more oversight?”
	1. full loop
3. “Would it be okay if I asked specifically about your experience with interviewing?”
	1. yes
4. “How does interviewing feel for you personally?”
	1. pretty comfortable
5. “Does it take anything away from you — time, focus, energy, or something else?”
	1. time intensive, lots of prep
	2. HR team not great at early screening


If after Q4 and Q5 they show **no cost, no frustration, no impact**, you stop early. That’s a valid weak-signal outcome.

6. "Can you walk me through the last time you went through an interview cycle?" (Context)
	1. about 1.5 years ago
	2. beg and plead to get role open
	3. zoom
7.  “How often does this come up for you?” (Frequency)
	1. 
8. “What happens if this doesn’t get handled well?” (Consequences)
	1. 
9. “What’s the most frustrating part about it for you?” (Emotional Heat)
	1. keeping track of where everything is
10. “What have you tried so far to deal with this?”  (Existing Solutions)
    Follow-ups:
	1. 
		- “Why didn’t that fully solve it?”
		- “What do you still dislike about it?”
11. “Compared to everything else you’re dealing with, where does this rank?” (Priority Check)
	1. 
12. “If this were magically solved, what would be different for you?” (Ideal Outcome - no pitching) 
	1.

### Summary (AI generated)
Mark has extensive leadership and hiring experience (CTO, Director, Senior Director, Microsoft, Geico, startups). He does **not experience interviewing as emotionally difficult**, but does experience it as **highly time-consuming, operationally messy, and coordination-heavy**.

The pain is not “interviewing itself,” but:
- Resume screening overload
- Fragmented workflows (Workday + email + calendar + human lag)
- Loss of state across long multi-week processes
- Manual coordination to ensure fairness, speed, and candidate experience
- The cognitive burden of _keeping everything straight_
    
He repeatedly built his **own shadow systems** (Trello boards, email tracking, personal workflows) to compensate for poor tooling and broken organizational processes.

He sees hiring as **strategically critical**, but the operational burden makes it fragile and error-prone.


### Goal tracking (AI generated)

### **Is the pain real?**

**Yes — but it is operational and cognitive, not emotional or interpersonal.**

He explicitly says the frustration is:

> “Keeping track of who have I reviewed? Who have we decided to interview? … making sure that there's a traceable workflow all on the way.”

--
### **How often does it occur?**

**Very frequent.**
- Every hiring cycle
- At every company
- Across multiple roles
- Across startups and enterprises

> “Very frequent. Yeah… at each of the startups, they didn't have any workflow whatsoever.”

--
### **How emotionally heavy is it?**

**Moderate frustration, low emotional distress.**

He is calm, analytical, and composed — not angry or upset — but clearly annoyed by inefficiency:

> “The most frustrating part is really just keeping track of this shit.”

--
### **Have they tried to solve it already?**

**Yes — extensively and repeatedly.**

He:
- Created Trello boards
- Built his own workflows
- Tried to push email-based loops (Microsoft style)
- Adapted around Workday

> “I actually went so far as to create my own workflow thing… a Trello board.”

--
### **Would solving it meaningfully improve their life or work?**

**Yes — it would improve quality, speed, fairness, and reduce cognitive load — but it is not perceived as “urgent pain.”**

He frames it as:

> “As a leader, hiring correctly is probably the number one thing you can do.”

But also:

> “Often it becomes not number one because of the realities of today.”

So: strategically important, operationally painful, but not felt as existential.

--
### **Strong signals**

- Interviewing is **operationally broken**, not conceptually broken
- Leaders build shadow systems to cope
- Tooling (Workday, ATS) is not trusted
- The pain is **coordination + state tracking**
- The cost is time, cognitive load, and fairness risk

### **Weak signals**
- Not emotionally intense
- Not perceived as urgent enough to demand immediate change
- He personally is comfortable interviewing — the pain is not interpersonal

### **Exact phrases worth remembering**

- “Keeping track of this shit.”
- “You just lose track of people.”
- “I actually went so far as to create my own workflow thing.”
- “Hiring correctly is probably the number one thing you can do.”

### **Surprises**
- He rejected automation that optimizes _steps_ instead of optimizing _outcomes_
- He strongly values fairness, traceability, and quality over speed
- He sees resume screening automation (AI) as optimizing the wrong thing
- The “pain” is not suffering — it is friction + waste


# **Bottom line**

✅ The pain is real  
✅ It happens often  
➖ It is not emotionally heavy  
✅ He has tried to solve it himself  
➖ It is strategically important but not urgent
