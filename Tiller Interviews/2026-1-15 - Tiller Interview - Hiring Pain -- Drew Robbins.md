## Tiller Focus – Hiring Interview Pain

I am tilling for:
Interviewing is time-consuming, exhausting, and mentally draining for hiring managers.

### Why this pain is being explored
- High emotional and time cost
- Repeated responsibility for managers
- Clear impact on productivity and focus
- Access to interviewees is high

### What this pain is NOT
- Recruiting or candidate sourcing
- Recruiting agencies
- ATS feature requests
- Employer branding problems

### Who I am interviewing
- Hiring managers
- Engineering managers
- Directors / CTOs
Criteria:
- Interviewed at least 3 candidates in the last 6 months
- Actively participates in interviews

### What counts as strong signal
- Repeated mention of time drain or fatigue
- Emotional frustration or dread
- Clear opportunity cost (other work pushed aside)
- Existing workarounds or attempts to reduce burden

### What counts as weak signal
- Indifference or resignation (“just part of the job”)
- Interviewing fully delegated away
- No emotional or time impact

### Exit criteria (this experiment ends when)
- 5–7 interviews completed
- Clear pattern OR clear lack of pain

---
### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas


I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with interviewing candidates in real life.

### Core Interview Questions

> Reminder: Record only for transcribe to generate summary


**Reminder (we have history)**
- he now lives in Japan
- he started .NET developers group
- I joined and worked on the web with James Neno and did other stuff
- I started reading his book (if I want to bring up)

Intro: 
"Thanks again for doing this. Just to restate, I’m not selling anything — I’m trying to understand how interviewing actually shows up in people’s work lives so I can learn from real experience  — not in theory, but in practice."

1. "Can you tell me a bit about your role and whether interviewing candidates is part of it?"
	1. IC role now but still leadership - Microsoft has reorg'd so there are many less leadership title roles but IC's include leadership
	2. 1 to 14 (mgr to IC)
	3. 
2. “What does your involvement usually look like — are you doing full interview loops, occasional panels, or more oversight?”
	1. full loop
3. “Would it be okay if I asked specifically about your experience with interviewing?”
	1. yes
4. “How does interviewing feel for you personally?”
	1. feel like know within first 2-3 minutes how it will go
	2. if not well, has to feel out 
	3. energy sucking
5. “Does it take anything away from you — time, focus, energy, or something else?”
	1. can be exhausting - take away time


If after Q4 and Q5 they show **no cost, no frustration, no impact**, you stop early. That’s a valid weak-signal outcome.

6. "Can you walk me through the last time you went through an interview cycle?" (Context)
	1. hired to new team in Japan - interviewed 4-5, 3 hireable offered 1
	2. engineering role, senior
7.  “How often does this come up for you?” (Frequency)
	1. depends, new team n OCT
	2. before several times mo.system inside ms has PM (recruiter) managing process
8. “What happens if this doesn’t get handled well?” (Consequences)
	1. 
9. “What’s the most frustrating part about it for you?” (Emotional Heat)
	1. still a lot of ... not too much at this point
	2. 1 says no, everyone else yes (usually new person says no, he wasn't 'passionate' enough)
10. “What have you tried so far to deal with this?”  (Existing Solutions)
	1. none
    Follow-ups:
	- “Why didn’t that fully solve it?”
	- “What do you still dislike about it?”
11. “Compared to everything else you’re dealing with, where does this rank?” (Priority Check)
	1. 
12. “If this were magically solved, what would be different for you?” (Ideal Outcome - no pitching) 
	1. inner personal skills
	2. larger pool of qualified candidates

### Goal
Fill out during/after but ensure all answered.
- Is the pain real?  
	- Yes
- How often does it occur?
	- Often
- How emotionally heavy is it?
	- Minimal (hmm, AI says different, i guess he did say emotionally draining...)
- Have they tried to solve it already?
	- No
- Would solving it meaningfully improve their life or work?
	- Yes

### Immediate Takeaways (5 minutes max)

### Summary (AI Generated)
Drew Robbins has decades of interviewing experience at Microsoft and in earlier leadership roles. Unlike Mark, he experiences interviewing as **emotionally draining and energy-intensive**, particularly when interviews go poorly. He views interviewing as highly important and often a top priority when hiring, but personally finds it taxing due to:

- The need to sustain engagement for 30 minutes even when a candidate is clearly not a fit
- The cognitive load of evaluating fairly
- Interpersonal fatigue as an introvert
- The difficulty of advocating internally for good candidates
- Inconsistencies and biases from other interviewers in the process
    
His pain is **more emotional and human-centered** than operational. Where Mark’s pain was process coordination, Drew’s pain is **people energy, emotional labor, and interviewer quality control**.

He has not tried to “solve” interviewing itself, because he largely accepts it as part of leadership, but he expressed strong interest in AI-assisted note-taking and interviewer coaching as potential improvements.


### Goal Tracking (AI generated)

### **Is the pain real?**

**Yes – very clearly.**

Drew explicitly describes interviewing as draining and exhausting, especially when it’s obvious early that a candidate is not a fit:

> “If it's not going well, I have to figure out how to fill the next 28 minutes… that can be very energy sucking.”

He also notes that poor interviews can negatively affect his energy for the next hour:

> “Sometimes it'll take away the next half an hour to an hour… interpersonal conversations can tire me out.”



### **How often does it occur?**

**Regularly, though dependent on hiring cycles.**
- In previous roles: “several times a month”
- In current role: less frequent due to fewer openings
- But over a long career: interviewing has been a constant activity
    
> “Before that, I was probably interviewing consistently… several times a month.”


### **How emotionally heavy is it?**

**Moderate to high emotional weight.**

Unlike Mark, Drew clearly feels the personal toll:
- Exhaustion from bad interviews
- Stress when disagreeing with other interviewers
- Frustration advocating for candidates internally
- Anxiety about making the right decision
    

He explicitly calls out the emotional cost:

> “That can be very energy sucking.”  
> “It may actually take away the next half an hour to an hour.”


### **Have they tried to solve it already?**

**Not directly.**
He hasn’t tried to change the process much. Instead he:
- Adapts his own interviewing style (more conversational)
- Coaches other interviewers
- Accepts interviewing as part of leadership
    
No explicit attempts at tooling or process fixes, but he imagines AI tools as a possible solution.


### **Would solving it meaningfully improve their life or work?**

**Yes.**
He directly articulated what “magical improvement” would look like:
- Automated note taking
- AI summarization
- Coaching interviewers in real time
- Better candidate screening
    

> “I would really love to just record and have my notes taken for me with an agent… and maybe even coach the interviewers throughout.”

This would reduce fatigue, bias, and cognitive burden.

### **Strong signals**
- Interviewing is **personally draining**, not just inconvenient
- Emotional energy is a major cost
- Bad interviews create lingering negative impact
- Internal disagreement in hiring decisions causes stress
- There is a desire for AI assistance in:
    - note taking
    - summarization
    - interviewer coaching
### **Weak signals**
- Frequency varies by role (not always constant pain)
- He accepts interviewing as “part of the job,” so not seeking radical change
- Not actively looking for solutions today

### **Exact phrases worth remembering**
- “That can be very energy sucking.”
- “I feel like I know within the first two to three minutes how the interview is going to go.”
- “I have to figure out how to fill the next 28 minutes.”
- “Sometimes it’ll take away the next half an hour to an hour.”
- “I would love to just record and have my notes taken for me with an agent.”

### **Surprises**
- Very different profile from Mark:
    - Mark: operational/process pain
    - Drew: emotional/interpersonal pain
- Strong enthusiasm for AI augmentation despite being a very experienced interviewer
- The pain point he emphasized most was not the candidate — it was **other interviewers and internal alignment**
