## Tiller Focus – Hiring Interview Pain

I am tilling for:
Interviewing is time-consuming, exhausting, and mentally draining for hiring managers.

### Why this pain is being explored
- High emotional and time cost
- Repeated responsibility for managers
- Clear impact on productivity and focus
- Access to interviewees is high

### What this pain is NOT
- Recruiting or candidate sourcing
- Recruiting agencies
- ATS feature requests
- Employer branding problems

### Who I am interviewing
- Hiring managers
- Engineering managers
- Directors / CTOs
Criteria:
- Interviewed at least 3 candidates in the last 6 months
- Actively participates in interviews

### What counts as strong signal
- Repeated mention of time drain or fatigue
- Emotional frustration or dread
- Clear opportunity cost (other work pushed aside)
- Existing workarounds or attempts to reduce burden

### What counts as weak signal
- Indifference or resignation (“just part of the job”)
- Interviewing fully delegated away
- No emotional or time impact

### Exit criteria (this experiment ends when)
- 5–7 interviews completed
- Clear pattern OR clear lack of pain

---
### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas

I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with interviewing candidates in real life.

### Core Interview Questions

1. Context  
    “Can you walk me through the last time this happened?”
2. Frequency  
    “How often does this come up for you?”
3. Consequences  
    “What happens if this doesn’t get handled well?”
4. Emotional Heat  
    “What’s the most frustrating part about it?”
5. Existing Solutions  
    “What have you tried so far to deal with this?”  
    Follow-ups:
	- “Why didn’t that fully solve it?”
	- “What do you still dislike about it?”
6. Priority Check  
    “Compared to everything else you’re dealing with, where does this rank?”
7. Ideal Outcome (no pitching)  
    “If this were magically solved, what would be different for you?”
