## Tiller Focus – Hiring Interview Pain

I am tilling for:
Interviewing is time-consuming, exhausting, and mentally draining for hiring managers.

### Why this pain is being explored
- High emotional and time cost
- Repeated responsibility for managers
- Clear impact on productivity and focus
- Access to interviewees is high

### What this pain is NOT
- Recruiting or candidate sourcing
- Recruiting agencies
- ATS feature requests
- Employer branding problems

### Who I am interviewing
- Hiring managers
- Engineering managers
- Directors / CTOs
Criteria:
- Interviewed at least 3 candidates in the last 6 months
- Actively participates in interviews

### What counts as strong signal
- Repeated mention of time drain or fatigue
- Emotional frustration or dread
- Clear opportunity cost (other work pushed aside)
- Existing workarounds or attempts to reduce burden

### What counts as weak signal
- Indifference or resignation (“just part of the job”)
- Interviewing fully delegated away
- No emotional or time impact

### Exit criteria (this experiment ends when)
- 5–7 interviews completed
- Clear pattern OR clear lack of pain

---
### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas


I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with interviewing candidates in real life.

"Thanks again for doing this. Just to restate, I’m not selling anything — I’m trying to understand how interviewing actually shows up in people’s work lives so I can learn from real experience  — not in theory, but in practice."

1. "Can you tell me a bit about your role and whether interviewing candidates is part of it?"

### Goal tracking (AI generated)

### **Is the pain real?**

**Yes – but it is a sourcing/fit pain, not an interviewing-process pain.**

Michael does not feel pain from interviewing itself. He enjoys it and views it as part of his executive DNA:

> “I don’t get stressed, I don’t get anxious… I actually enjoy the conversation.

However, he clearly feels pain around _getting the right candidates in front of him_:

> “Getting me three real people that are going to match my corporate culture… is some magic bullet.”

### **How often does it occur?**

**Frequently whenever hiring is active.**

He is currently interviewing for key startup roles (CMO, CTO, CPO). In past roles he interviewed heavily:

> “Interviewing and finding the right people is probably closer to a nine or a ten.”


### **How emotionally heavy is it?**

**Low.**

Interviewing itself does not drain him emotionally. He explicitly frames it as a responsibility he accepts:

> “It’s baked into my DNA… it’s baked into my job description.”

Frustration exists, but mostly toward:
- HR automation
- unrealistic candidate expectations
- generational attitudes

### **Have they tried to solve it already?**

**Not directly, but he has strong opinions about current “solutions.”**
He is skeptical of automated ATS filtering:

> “I do not care for the automated HR solutions that we weed people out.”

He believes automation often filters out the best candidates and rewards gaming the system with AI-optimized resumes.

### **Would solving it meaningfully improve their life or work?**

**Yes – significantly.**
For him, a magic solution would be:
- Top 3 genuinely qualified candidates
- Matched to culture
- Without sifting through hundreds of resumes

> “What the magic solution to me is the top three candidates that meet my requirements that I can interview instead of dealing with 500 resumes.”


### **Immediate Takeaways**

### **Strong signals**
- Interviewing itself is **not painful** for him
- The real pain is **candidate discovery and filtering**
- ATS/automation is viewed as making things worse
- Startup hiring has unique challenges:
    - compensation expectations
    - candidate mindset
    - cultural fit
- Hiring quality is existentially important for funding and success

### **Weak signals**
- No operational or coordination pain like Mark
- No emotional fatigue like Drew
- Not seeking tools for interviewing itself

### **Exact phrases worth remembering**
- “I actually enjoy the conversation.”
- “It’s baked into my DNA.”
- “Interviewing and finding the right people is probably closer to a nine or a ten.”
- “Getting me three real people that match my culture is some magic bullet.”
- “I do not care for the automated HR solutions.”

### **Surprises**
- He explicitly rejects the premise that interviewing is a burden
- His main frustration is with **upstream sourcing**, not the interview process
- Strong negative view of ATS filtering and AI-optimized resumes
- Pain centered on **startup hiring constraints** rather than interview logistics
