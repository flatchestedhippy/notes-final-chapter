## **Tiller Close-Out: Interviewing Pain (Jan–Feb 2026)**

**Conclusion:**  
I am closing the interviewing-pain line of inquiry.

**Why:**  
Interviewing pain is **real but episodic**, highly **time-bound**, and **context-dependent**. Meaningful insight only exists for people _actively hiring right now_. Retrospective interviews mostly surface rationalized, systematized, or outdated perspectives.

**Key evidence:**

- None of the interviewees were actively interviewing at the time.
- Strongest signals came from historical pain, not current urgency.
- Most participants framed interviewing as _inconvenient_, not costly.
- The real bottleneck consistently surfaced as **sourcing**, not decision-making.
- Traditional competence signals (tests, assignments) are now compromised by LLMs, fundamentally changing the evaluation landscape.
- The problem space is shifting too fast for reflective discovery to stay relevant.
    

**Core insight extracted (and retained):**

> LLMs have broken legacy hiring signals. Interviewing is becoming an adversarial evaluation problem, not a process design problem.

This insight is valid — but **not** a domain I want to pursue, build in, or live inside.

**Decision:**  
I am not pursuing
- Interviewing tools
- Hiring services
- Interview-process optimization
- Products aimed at general hiring pain

This thread is closed without regret.

1/22/2026 - after 3 interviews:
- Mark Harris
- Drew Robbins
- Michael Littman

- Which interview was most interesting to me?
	- Mark Harris - I found his conversation more personal / interesting.
- Which bored me?
	- Michael Littman - CFO even though his content may have been most interesting as he is startup looking to fund 2M and is currently hiring a lot to build an 'A' team that he hopes will help procure the funding.
- Which pain felt most real?
	- Marks - he went so far as to create a system to try and resolve it - he is the only one that has so far
- Which felt like “meh”?
	- Michael Littman - mostly just because of his demeanor - not that it was bad, just not like a guy I would want to have dinner with to discuss business, unlike Mark Harris or Drew Robbins
