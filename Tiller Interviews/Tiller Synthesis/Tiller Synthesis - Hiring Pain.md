1/22/2026 - after 3 interviews:
- Mark Harris
- Drew Robbins
- Michael Littman

- Which interview was most interesting to me?
	- Mark Harris - I found his conversation more personal / interesting.
- Which bored me?
	- Michael Littman - CFO even though his content may have been most interesting as he is startup looking to fund 2M and is currently hiring a lot to build an 'A' team that he hopes will help procure the funding.
- Which pain felt most real?
	- Marks - he went so far as to create a system to try and resolve it - he is the only one that has so far
- Which felt like “meh”?
	- Michael Littman - mostly just because of his demeanor - not that it was bad, just not like a guy I would want to have dinner with to discuss business, unlike Mark Harris or Drew Robbins
