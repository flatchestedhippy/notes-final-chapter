## Tiller Focus – Hiring Interview Pain

I am tilling for:
Interviewing is time-consuming, exhausting, and mentally draining for hiring managers.

### Why this pain is being explored
- High emotional and time cost
- Repeated responsibility for managers
- Clear impact on productivity and focus
- Access to interviewees is high

### What this pain is NOT
- Recruiting or candidate sourcing
- Recruiting agencies
- ATS feature requests
- Employer branding problems

### Who I am interviewing
- Hiring managers
- Engineering managers
- Directors / CTOs
Criteria:
- Interviewed at least 3 candidates in the last 6 months
- Actively participates in interviews

### What counts as strong signal
- Repeated mention of time drain or fatigue
- Emotional frustration or dread
- Clear opportunity cost (other work pushed aside)
- Existing workarounds or attempts to reduce burden

### What counts as weak signal
- Indifference or resignation (“just part of the job”)
- Interviewing fully delegated away
- No emotional or time impact

### Exit criteria (this experiment ends when)
- 5–7 interviews completed
- Clear pattern OR clear lack of pain

---
### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas


I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with interviewing candidates in real life.

### Core Interview Questions

> Reminder: Record only for transcribe to generate summary

Intro: 
"Thanks again for doing this. Just to restate, I’m not selling anything — I’m trying to understand how interviewing actually shows up in people’s work lives so I can learn from real experience  — not in theory, but in practice. 

I’m especially trying to understand where interviewing or the hiring process creates real friction for you — time, stress, coordination, anything like that.."

1. "Can you tell me a bit about your role and whether interviewing candidates is part of it?"
	1. 
2. “What does your involvement usually look like — are you doing full interview loops, occasional panels, or more oversight?”
	1. 
3. “Would it be okay if I asked specifically about your experience with interviewing?”
	1. 
4. "When you think about interviewing candidates, does it tend to feel energizing for you, neutral, or draining?"
	1. 
5. “Does it take anything away from you — time, focus, energy, or something else?”
	1. 


If after Q4 and Q5 they show **no cost, no frustration, no impact**, you stop early. That’s a valid weak-signal outcome.

6. "Can you walk me through the last time you went through an interview cycle?" (Context)
	1. 
7.  “How often does this come up for you?” (Frequency)
	1. 
8. “What happens if this doesn’t get handled well?” (Consequences)
	1. 
9. “What’s the most frustrating part about it for you?” (Emotional Heat)
	1. 
10. “What have you tried so far to deal with this?”  (Existing Solutions)
	1. 
    Follow-ups:
	- “Why didn’t that fully solve it?”
	- “What do you still dislike about it?”
11. “Compared to everything else you’re dealing with, where does this rank?” (Priority Check)
	1. 
12. “If this were magically solved, what would be different for you?” (Ideal Outcome - no pitching) 
	1.
