## Tiller Focus – Hiring Interview Pain

I am tilling for:
Interviewing is time-consuming, exhausting, and mentally draining for hiring managers.

### Why this pain is being explored
- High emotional and time cost
- Repeated responsibility for managers
- Clear impact on productivity and focus
- Access to interviewees is high

### What this pain is NOT
- Recruiting or candidate sourcing
- Recruiting agencies
- ATS feature requests
- Employer branding problems

### Who I am interviewing
- Hiring managers
- Engineering managers
- Directors / CTOs
Criteria:
- Interviewed at least 3 candidates in the last 6 months
- Actively participates in interviews

### What counts as strong signal
- Repeated mention of time drain or fatigue
- Emotional frustration or dread
- Clear opportunity cost (other work pushed aside)
- Existing workarounds or attempts to reduce burden

### What counts as weak signal
- Indifference or resignation (“just part of the job”)
- Interviewing fully delegated away
- No emotional or time impact

### Exit criteria (this experiment ends when)
- 5–7 interviews completed
- Clear pattern OR clear lack of pain

---
### Stay focused on the person not the opportunity
- A conversation to understand reality
- Focused on past behavior, not opinions
- About pain, frequency, and consequences
- Not a pitch or validation of my ideas


I’m not selling anything. I’m just trying to understand how people deal with interviewing candidates in real life.

### Core Interview Questions

> Reminder: Record only for transcribe to generate summary

Intro: 
"Thanks again for doing this. Just to restate, I’m not selling anything — I’m trying to understand how interviewing actually shows up in people’s work lives so I can learn from real experience  — not in theory, but in practice. 

** changed from template **
I’m especially trying to understand where people decisions around hiring create real friction for you — time, mental load, coordination, or downstream impact.."

1. "Can you tell me a bit about your role and whether interviewing candidates is part of it?"
	1. current role not much, past roles lots of interviewing - currently IC
2. “What does your involvement usually look like — are you doing full interview loops, occasional panels, or more oversight?”
	1. number of small business, have hired 100's of people
	2. interviewing and supervisor
3. "When you think about interviewing candidates, does it tend to feel energizing for you, neutral, or draining?"
	1. enjoy cause like meeting people
	2. inconvenience - often times either growing - stress working on 10 things at once
		1. or replacing someone
4. “Does it take anything away from you — time, focus, energy, momentum or something else?”
	1. yes  - takes time
	2. is this person going to match and how to test for that


If after Q4 and Q5 they show **no cost, no frustration, no impact**, you stop early. That’s a valid weak-signal outcome.

*** changed
6. "Can you walk me through the last time you had to make a meaningful hiring decision?" (Context)
	1. around crucial people on engineering team
	2. typically like to put people in where acting in same way as in job - often time 3 phase meet
		1. initial,  flags on resume
		2. programming assignment - 2hrs or so
		3. go through what they did, ask questions on decisions made
		4. now llms just answer
7.  “How often does this come up for you?” (Frequency)
	1. different years were different, prob hired 50 people
8. “What happens if this doesn’t get handled well?” (Consequences)
	1. 
9. “What’s the most frustrating part about it for you?” (Emotional Heat)
	1. finding candidates is expensive and hard
	2. if did get candidates, going through correspondence worth hiring
	3. up front work most challenging
10. “What have you tried so far to deal with this?”  (Existing Solutions)
	1. avoid paying hefty fee
	2. business partner doing a lot of web scraping
	3. talking to network
	4. recruiters last choice
    Follow-ups:
	- “Why didn’t that fully solve it?”
	- “What do you still dislike about it?”
11. “Compared to everything else you’re dealing with, where does this rank?” (Priority Check)
	1. low
	2. a lot of other things to do
12. “If this were magically solved, what would be different for you?” (Ideal Outcome - no pitching) 
	1. sourcing is the problem
	2. adequately find qualified people
