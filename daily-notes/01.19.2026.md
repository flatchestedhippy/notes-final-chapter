![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- Insurance - when I go fully on my own I can specify my 'yearly' salary to get benefits very low - Kaiser like $4/mo. -- adjusted at end of year but sill this is better than the thousands per month I thought it was going to cost
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Get the Amazon returns ready
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Prepped for today's Tiller Interview Michael Littman
	- He was CFO for Northwoods in 2015
	- He was Director before that for Northwoods in 2012
- Reviewed/Updated notes from tiller interview
- Updated tiller template 
	- Be specific on the purpose of the interview - looking for where the friction is for the person
	- replace vague: “How does interviewing feel for you personally?” with: "When you think about interviewing candidates, does it tend to feel energizing for you, neutral, or draining?"
- Checked LinkedIn - no new responses
