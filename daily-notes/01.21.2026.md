Follow up
```
Hi {}, just checking back in on this in case it got buried.  
I’m still looking to have a few short conversations with people who’ve been involved in interviewing to understand their experience.

If you’re open to it, I’d really appreciate 20–30 minutes of your perspective. If not, no problem at all.
