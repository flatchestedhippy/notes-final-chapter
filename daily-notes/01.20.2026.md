![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- Having a lemon tree. I can pick lemons when I make Salmon and its very convenient.
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Showed up and enhanced the process
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Woke up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Checked LinkedIn - no new responses
	- Sent follow up to batch #2 [[Outreach Batches - Hiring Pain#Outreach Batches]]
- I have yet to get source control working for these notes, going to do that now as loosing some/all could set me back - for instance, the outreach


LinkedIn follow up

Hi {{Name}}, just checking back in on this in case it got buried.  
I’m still looking to have a few short conversations with people who’ve been involved in interviewing to understand their experience.

If you’re open to it, I’d really appreciate 20–30 minutes of your perspective. If not, no problem at all.
