- I'm grateful for: 
	- My happy son. He has been so happy lately & brightens up my day.
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Show up
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- Wrote a thank you email to Gary for the check. I normally wouldn't even do that even though I really appreciated it.
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Checked LinkedIn, actually got 2 YES's!!!! (responses below)
	- Drew Robbins - currently in Japan
		- This one is actually a big deal. I was in .NET user group when .NET first came about - he head started the group. He became a big MS executive & is a published author, speaker, etc.
			- [Book & site](https://www.drewby.com/)
