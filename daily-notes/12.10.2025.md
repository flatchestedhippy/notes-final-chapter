		- "My Why":  I want to live a life free of the stress of worrying about money so that I can focus on my son and my own well being. I want to build a better foundation for my son so that he has a better chance of being successful as he grows up.  I want to be present with him and with everything else I do. I don't want to ask for permission to go see a play at school or some other 'during office hours' event.
