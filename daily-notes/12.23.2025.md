Here is the message I'm sending via LinkedIn
```
Hi {{Name}} - quick context and I’ll be brief.

I’m doing a short, interview-only research exercise on how time-consuming and mentally draining interviews are for people who participate in hiring decisions (panels, loops, managers, senior ICs).

This is not recruiting, not a product pitch, and may go nowhere - I’m simply documenting lived experience around interview fatigue and opportunity cost.

If you’ve been involved in interviewing and are open to a 20–30 min conversation, I’d really value your perspective. Totally fine if now’s not a good time.

Either way, appreciate you reading.

Keith
