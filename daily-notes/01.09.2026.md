	- I had to call about medical bill and was very kind to the support even thought I was extremely angry about the bill and the their comments
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Yesterday I purchased Drew Robbins book:  When No One's Keeping Score
	- Started reading it and adding back my 10m daily read. This does not take away from my current activities as I'm not going back into 'Research' mode and reading something completely different.
