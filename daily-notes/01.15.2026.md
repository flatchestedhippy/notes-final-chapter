- I'm grateful for: 
	- Having a robot that vacuums and mops and auto fills/drains - saves me time and more importantly keeps the house looking nice so that I dont have to think about it
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Continued on when I would have rather went back to sleep
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Woke up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Sent myself email reminder:  AOS (Act of Service)

	- Drew responded back, said he could do tomorrow at 11:30
		- this was one of the JST times I sent him (this is 6:30PM my time)
