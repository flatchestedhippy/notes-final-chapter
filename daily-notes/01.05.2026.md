Hi , hope you had a good start to the new year.

I’m picking this back up now that things are settling after the holidays.  
If you’re open to a short, low-key conversation about your experience with interviewing, I’d really value your perspective. No pressure at all.

Either way, wishing you a smooth start to 2026.

Hello Gary,

Happy New Year! I just wanted to thank you for the wonderful unexpected gift you sent as part of the Northwoods sale. Not only do I appreciate that it was really great just to see your name come across. I still think of all of the great times at Northwoods: the trips, parties and fun times we all had together. I always enjoyed your company and can still hear the laughter. I miss ya man!

I hope your New Year is filled with wonder and fullfillment.

xoxxxooxxox

Love Always,

Keith
