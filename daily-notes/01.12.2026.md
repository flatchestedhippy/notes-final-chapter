![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- Having fixed my eyes (cataract + lasik) and no longer being dependent on glasses. Its been about 1.5 years and its great to be able to work on the computer, drive, read - w/o switching between 2 different glasses and then them off (for reading) 
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Enhance the bathroom I recently updated - added corner shelves which helped a lot since the bathroom is tiny and it took up no previous used space
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Today is first scheduled Tiller interview in 20m
- Checked LinkedIn - only 'spam' from adding to my connections
- Waiting in google meet for Mark Harris, sent linkedIn message below
	- waited until 6:15

```
Hi Mark — just wanted to check in in case something went sideways with the calendar or link.  
I’m here on the Google Meet whenever you’re ready.

### If I Finish Early → Do ONE:
- Tighten CPSO (where apply)
	- write more clearly
	- add emotional context
	- clarify who
	- what are consequences
	- tighten pain/offer
- Are patterns in pain emerging?
- What would make Tiller interviews easier next week?
	- questions to ask
	- finding persons to interview
- Improve morning system
- Write letter to son
- Automation
- Health - more stretching, meditation, etc.
