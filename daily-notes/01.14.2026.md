- I'm grateful for: 
	- My sons personality - he makes my days better
	- Buying gold when I did, it surged a lot
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Went into the Tiller interview with more personal gesture than getting right down to business. I think it helped form a bond with Mark Harris
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- Polite to a spam caller
- Woke up at 5AM
- Stretched 10+m
- Mediated 5m
- Checked LinkedIn - just more spam from adding more connections
- Revisited yesterdays tiller interview [[2026-1-06 - Tiller Interview - Hiring Pain -- Mark Harris]]

	- Did NOT get to send request to 'Michael Gilmore'


In my group
```
Hi {{Name}}, we’re in the same 7CTO group and I’ve enjoyed the conversations there.  
Would be great to connect here as well.

```
Hi Drew, just wanted to check back in in case this got lost in the shuffle.  
I know things can get busy, especially across time zones.

If you’re still open to it, I’d really appreciate the conversation, but no worries at all if now isn’t a good time.
