![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- having a new 3d printer, I really needed it and missed mine
	- Williams teacher letting me know he is winning an award on Jan 30th at the assembly so that I can be present
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- designed/used shims in CAD for 3d print for the new shower door
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Validated my reason for continuing current trajectory of exploring hiring pain
- Looked up definitions for my 'Needs Work' below to ensure I focus on the proper thing
	- updated template to reflect
- Finalized (minor) tweak to [[Template - Hiring Pain]]
- Created Interview Sheet from template for Drew in preparation and so I can go through again and make sure it all make sense & to review what my goals actually are and try to stick to them
	- Do:
		- listen
		- ask questions
		- stay focused on the person, not the opportunity
	- Don't 
		- validate pains or solutions
		- offer solutions
- Checked LinkedIn, no new replies to follow up & no response yet for suggested interview date/times to Drew Robbins / Mark Harris



### Final
What did I move forward today?
- showed up - went to bed with William at 9:30PM, I was exhausted.  I have been able to get up at 5 pretty easily so far but this morning I just wanted to go back to sleep. I'm still really tired.  I was also 'demotivated' about the whole tiller prospect around 'interviewing pain' - seems antiquated and I felt I should be focused on robotics.
	- Takeaway:  What hurts now, repeatedly, for real people with budget and agency? -- this is the 'now' opportunity!  This helped me stay motivated to continue!
