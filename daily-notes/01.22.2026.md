![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- A land of opportunity. In some areas of the world, my options would or could be very limited
	- My communication ability. I can meet with and inspire people. I can get them to believe in me and my vision.
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Got prepared for my early morning work meeting
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- Texted my Aunt Jo to let her know I was thinking about her
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Meditated 5m
	- realized I had been spelling meditated, mediated -- haha, it was just my fingers flowing, I know how to spell it, funny how the mind works sometimes :)
- Other
	- Just noting that my Tiller interview referenced in [[01.19.2026]] with Michael LIttman - even though he worked at Northwoods, he never knew I did at the time he offered to do an interview & help
- Checked LinkedIn - just one spam

- Write letter to son
- Automation
- Health - more stretching, meditation, etc.
