![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- 
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- 
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- 
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- xx
- Woke up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- I have not been doing my 5AM.  I pulled my back on Friday 23rd (sciatic nerve) doing dead lifts :(
	- today is the first day I have woken up in the morning w/o unbearable pain - its been getting slowly better, was certain it was going to last much longer but today give me hope, maybe after full 2 weeks+ I'll be good
- I have another tiller interview today with John Wallace


### Final
What did I move forward today?
- 
---
### Current Routine
- [ ] Review last few of days of notes
- [ ] Review why/purpose



### Needs Work
- Social Self Esteem (socially worthy)

### If I Finish Early → Do ONE:
- Tighten CPSO (where apply)
	- write more clearly
	- add emotional context
	- clarify who
	- what are consequences
	- tighten pain/offer
- Are patterns in pain emerging?
- What would make Tiller interviews easier next week?
	- questions to ask
	- finding persons to interview
- Improve morning system
- Write letter to son
- Automation
- Health - more stretching, meditation, etc.
