- Meditated 5m
- I have not been doing my 5AM.  I pulled my back on Friday 23rd (sciatic nerve) doing dead lifts :(
	- today is the first day I have woken up in the morning w/o unbearable pain - its been getting slowly better, was certain it was going to last much longer but today give me hope, maybe after full 2 weeks+ I'll be good
- I have another tiller interview today with John Wallace
- Other
	- I have agreed to work 1 more week for Kingsmen, so last day will be next Friday February 13th
	- I know how to spell meditated, but I keep saying mediated lol - noticed when going over previous notes so fixed todays.. odd

### If I Finish Early → Do ONE:

	- what are consequences
	- tighten pain/offer
- Are patterns in pain emerging?
- What would make Tiller interviews easier next week?
	- questions to ask
	- finding persons to interview
- Improve morning system
- Write letter to son
- Automation
- Health - more stretching, meditation, etc.
