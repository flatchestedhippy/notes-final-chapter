![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- A comfortable bed
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Prioritize my work
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Woke up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Having rescheduled tiller interview with Mark Harris - he didn't show yesterday (see below)
	- Note: there was no mention of West Monroe / RVL - even if its the same company he has no idea that client went to Kingsmen

### If I Finish Early → Do ONE:
- Tighten CPSO (where apply)
	- write more clearly
	- add emotional context
	- clarify who
	- what are consequences
	- tighten pain/offer
- Are patterns in pain emerging?
- What would make Tiller interviews easier next week?
	- questions to ask
	- finding persons to interview
- Improve morning system
- Write letter to son
- Automation
- Health - more stretching, meditation, etc.
