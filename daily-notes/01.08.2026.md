![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- My son being happier than ever. 
	- Having 2 bathrooms so that I had ample time to properly fix the master bath
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Prioritize my work
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- none
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 20m
- Mediated 10m
- Checked LinkedIn
	- Got response from Mark Harris for meeting (see below, he is EST)
		- I just realized from is email address. This is the IT company that worked for one of our clients (ft job) that we replaced.  We are no longer working with that client, but interesting - especially considering... 
		- Set up & sent meeting invite and LinkedIn response
