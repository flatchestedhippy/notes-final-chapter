- I'm grateful for: 
	- Having an electric car
	- Not having a car payment
	- Not having to get a smog check
	- Not having to get an oil change
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Tune in to pain signals
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- Complimented someone
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- Review notes from last couple of days
- Added 'Impact' column to CPSO (1-5) and updated
	- noted the only 5 was added today camelcamelcamel because it directly affects finances


### Final
What did I move forward today?
- Opening mind to ways businesses actually solve pain & make a bucket doing so (camelcamelcamel)
- Understand of process for when to interview & how
