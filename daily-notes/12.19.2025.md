- I'm grateful for: 
	- Gary - he sent me money (Northwoods) after having not worked there for over 15 years. He sold the company and gave all employees past/present a piece
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Tune into pain more frequent
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- Extra nice to Del Taco worker & wished happy holidays
- Up at 5AM
- Stretched 10m
- Meditated 5m (very good one this morning)
- Review last couple days of notes 
	- added to current routine in template
- Work on pain filters & deciding what to move to Till
- Created Tiller templates to make interview prep super friction-less
