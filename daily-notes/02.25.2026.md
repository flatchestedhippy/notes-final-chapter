- Getting PC reformatted and set up with latest (has been a while since I rebuilt).  This may be neat to keep a note of.  I have used Linux for a long time and always bounce around between distros.
	- was using Debian 12
	- changed to Fedora 43
		- name: nova
- Other - still have back pain but im about 85% better finally.  Now im able to clean, lift - put my socks on -- the little things :(
	- Its been ~1mo, 2days and I have not been able to exercise (lift, run)

---
I need to get prepped for gearing up again, all of this is TODO with priority
