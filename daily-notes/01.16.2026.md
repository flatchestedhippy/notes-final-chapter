![[12.11.2025#Why (short)]]


- I'm grateful for: 
	- Having options. Although I'm currently stressed due to current job I have enough savings/investments to allow for change if necessary.
	- Knowing what I would do if my current job does not work out.  I have been there for 6 years but I am ready to leave.  In that case, i can apply for high paying jobs or continue this endeavor full time which might even make the most sense
- One thing I did well yesterday:
	- Showed up for my 6:30PM Tiller interview (Since Drew Robbins is in Japan). Made fruit to hold my son over until dinner - prepped dinner and had it ready ~7:10
- Am I doing the work I said I'd do today? (Yes / No)
	- Yes
- What small act of service did you do yesterday?
	- Tipped way more than i wanted to at sub shop.  It was one of my developers last day at work - I took him to lunch on my dime. I tipped 20% -- which I think is crazy these days due to already inflated prices and the fact that these places never used to ask for tips - and they are just creating sandwiches and getting tipped before you even know if your food is right/good.
- Work up at 5AM (actually woke up ~4:30 and couldn't go back to sleep so laid in bed until ~5AM -- OK, I'm seeing a pattern with my current job - I think its time to leave ASAP)
- Stretched 10m
- Mediated 5m
- I have daily 11AM message to remind me to 'Check Lense' - basically listen out for pain / opportunities. I've added AOS to this as I feel like I need to keep this in my mind to do Act Of Service daily
- Reviewed and updated Tiller interview from yesterday with Drew Robbins
- Created tracking for outreach [[Outreach Batches - Hiring Pain]] & updated [[Start]] to show totals so I can easily see current progress
- Prep template for LinkedIn follow up to batch 2 next week (below)
- sent out 7 more invites
	- "Founder" OR "Co-Founder" OR "Technical Founder" OR "Founder & CTO"

It's almost 5:30PM, usually I don't check LinkedIn until the next day but its Friday and I saw messages, 3 of them
1.) Nash Bober:  
	Asking "Just for people making the decisions? :)" -> responded with not really (see LinkedIn)
2.)  Michael Littman
	"Happy to help" -> send 3 times next week 6AM mon,tues,wed (he is Columbus Ohio)
3.)  Christopher Peret

Hi {{Name}}, just checking back in on this in case it got buried.  
I’m still looking to have a few short conversations with people who’ve been involved in interviewing to understand their experience.

If you’re open to it, I’d really appreciate 20–30 minutes of your perspective. If not, no problem at all.
```

What did I move forward today?
- on top of current tiller interviews, added tracking & sent out more requests for interviews
Other
